### Declaratively manage your user environment
To declaratively manage your user environment you can add your tools to `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix` like so [config.nix](/examples/nixpkgs-config.nix/declarative-user-environments/config.nix).

There is also some work in progress on user services:
- [nixuser](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/9250)

And some stuff to managing dotfiles:
- [nix-home](https://github.com/sheenobu/nix-home)
